## Troubleshooting

For help with issues which you might encounter when using this template, please refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

## Gradle Setup üêò

This template is using [**Gradle Kotlin DSL**](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) as well as the [Plugin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block) to setup the build.

Dependencies are centralized inside the Gradle Version Catalog in the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml) file in the `gradle` folder.

## Static Analysis üîç

This template is using [**detekt**](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) to analyze the source code, with the configuration that is stored in the [detekt.yml](config/detekt/detekt.yml) file (the file has been generated with the `detektGenerateConfig` task). It also uses the **detekt-formatting** plugin which includes the ktlint rules (see https://detekt.dev/docs/rules/formatting/).

## CI ‚öôÔ∏è

This template is using [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template/actions) as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you should have a running CI once you start using this template, just make sure that you turn on the "Read and Write permissions" on the Action Settings of your repository.

There are currently the following workflows available:
- [Validate Gradle Wrapper](.github/workflows/gradle-wrapper-validation.yml) - Will check that the gradle wrapper has a valid checksum
- [Pre Merge Checks](.github/workflows/pre-merge.yaml) - Will run the `build`, `check` and `publishToMavenLocal` tasks.
- [Publish Snapshot](.github/workflows/publish-snapshot.yaml) - Will publish a `-SNAPSHOT` of the libraries to Sonatype.
- [Publish Release](.github/workflows/publish-release.yaml) - Will publish a new release version of the libraries to Maven Central on tag pushes.


## Project Structure

This project structure was inspired from [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) repository. The project includes three sub-projects, each in their own subdirectories:

- **`app`:** The source for the final Android application.
- **`library-android`:** The source for an Android library including UI.
- **`library-kotlin`:** The source for a UI-less Kotlin library.
- **`library-compose`:** The source for a UI library with Jetpack Compose library.

The following additional top-level directories configure & support building the app & projects:

- **`buildSrc`:** Contains shared Gradle logic as [precompiled script plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html#sec:precompiled_plugins)
- **`config`:** Contains the [Detekt configuration file](https://detekt.dev/docs/introduction/configurations/).
- **`gradle`:** Contains Gradle Configuration files such as the Gradle Version Catalog and the [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

Finally, the following hidden top-level directories provide functionality for specific development systems:

- **`.github`:** Defines the [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI tasks and templates for new pull requests, issues, etc.
- **`.idea`:** Sets common initial project settings when the project is opened in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
